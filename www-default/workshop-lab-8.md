### Explore the Virtual Thumbnail for Cloud Instances

The web interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent providers. Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which display basic information about each provider.

**[INSERT_IMAGE_HERE]**

* The top left quadrant shows the operating system running on the instance.
* The top right quadrant shows status of the instance.
* The image in the bottom left quadrant represents the type of provider the instance is running on (Amazon EC2 or OpenStack).
* The bottom right quadrant shows the number of snapshots for this instance.
*  A <i class="fa fa-shield fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> (**Policy**) in the center indicates that this host has one or more policies applied.
