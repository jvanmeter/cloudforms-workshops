### What's a Provider?

In Red Hat CloudForms, an infrastructure provider is a virtual infrastructure environment that you can add to a Red Hat CloudForms appliance to manage and interact with the resources in that environment. This lab describes the different types of infrastructure providers that you can add to Red Hat CloudForms, and how to manage them.

A list of your datacenter infrastructure providers appears, such as VMware vCenter and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

The web interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent providers. Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which display basic information about each provider.
